# Match history (key)
---
the match history may not work because the key is out dated .
## What should I do ?
#### If You Have account 
then you need to sing in in [riot games](https://developer.riotgames.com/) to get your key . Then after cloning the app you have to go to ./src/Redux/store.js and change the key 
#### if you don't have account 
you need  to connect to the owner of this app (alaasassijs@gmail.com)

this got some bugs now :(
